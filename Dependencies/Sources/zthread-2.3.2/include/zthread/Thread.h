   *
   * A thread is started simply by constructing a thread object and giving 
   * it a task to perform. The thread will continue to run its task, even 
   * after the Thread object used to launch the thread has gone out of scope.
   *

   * <h2><a name="ex2">Waiting for a task</a></h2>
   *
   * A user can exercise some simple synchronization by waiting for a thread
   * to complete running its task.

   * using namespace ZThread;

   *
   * <h2><a name="ex3">Sharing a task</a></h2>
   *
   * The same task can be shared by more than one thread. A Task is constructed
   * from a Runnable, and that Task object is copied by value and handed off to
   * each thread.
