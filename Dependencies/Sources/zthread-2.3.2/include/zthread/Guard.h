 * @date <2003-07-16T17:55:42-0400>
 * @version 2.2.0
 *
 * Scoped locking utility. This template class can be given a Lockable
 * synchronization object and can 'Guard' or serialize access to 
 * that method.
 *  
 * For instance, consider a case in which a class or program have a  
 * Mutex object associated with it. Access can be serialized with a 
 * Guard as shown below.
 *
 * @code
 *
 * Mutex _mtx;
 * void guarded() {
 * 
 *    Guard<Mutex> g(_mtx);
 *
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * The Guard will lock the synchronization object when it is created and 
 * automatically unlock it when it goes out of scope. This eliminates 
 * common mistakes like forgetting to unlock your mutex.
 *
 * An alternative to the above example would be 
 *
 * @code
 *
 * void guarded() {
 *
 *     (Guard<Mutex>)(_mtx);
 *
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * HOWEVER; using a Guard in this method is dangerous. Depending on your
 * compiler an anonymous variable like this can go out of scope immediately
 * which can result in unexpected behavior. - This is the case with MSVC
 * and was the reason for introducing assertions into the Win32_MutexImpl
 * to track this problem down
 *
